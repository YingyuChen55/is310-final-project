# Wonders about OCR

## Some Thoughts:
- On additional materials for Mar 1, 2022, I read [Hannah Alpert Adams “Machine Reading the Primeros Libros”](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/4/000268/000268.html). The author illustrates a unique point that 'dirty' OCR can 'reveal both historical and cultural factors at play in the practice of automatic transcription'(Adams,2016).
  
- Before, I have conscious about data science and history, or improving OCR to increase accuracy, but this article gives me new insight about data in language field. For example, we will not use use *Alice in Wonderland* as language data for the automatic transcription of the *Primeros Libros*. This is similar to the training in machine learning that we need to pay more attention to the training set. In other word, yes, we need to understand our data in different uses.
