# Wonders about NER and NLP

## Some Thoughts:
- This week, we have been into named-entity recognition as part of the natural language processing. It is an advanced name tagging / labeling tool that helps identify particular things. It has two major approach -- grammer-based rules and statistical model. 
    
- I was doing some text analysis from open eneded data for one of my project, and one goal I was trying to achieve is to find the frequency of the theme from overall responses. I first tried to manuualy type all the key related words myself, but later I found it is hard to do it myself becuase there are too many of them. Then I tried to use dictionary API to find the relavent words, but it is still different from what I thought, for example, what I want to do is that, when I type 'depression', I should get relavent result like 'anxiety', 'mental health' but the dictionary synonymous returns different results like 'abasement'. Than I started to realize the helpfullness from NEC and NLP. That it is a useful and smart way to really intepretate the text from computer. 

- I also realize how the linguistic and computer are tight to each other, or in other word, the overlap between literacy and computer science. We need to know both to let the computer understand what we mean, and to help computer know what the text ,or the language mean for us.
