# Wonders about Network

## Some Thoughts:
- I have read some reading about social networking before, the reading was about the happier the people around you, the more money you will be likely to make. I was always amazed by how the researchers get the numbers from people. 

- However, some of the claims are based on correlation rather than an controlled experiment to prove causation. What if is the people that already have much money does not have to worry about other problems? These are some questions that comes into my mind relating to social networking, research ethic and digital humanity.
